# Anki Cardtype for Chinese Handwriting

Based on [this Reddit response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/5s98bp/comment/dddj3vh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), adapted to my own needs.

## Building

```sh
yarn install
pipenv shell
yarn anki

Now import `output.apkg` into anki.
